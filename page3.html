        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <ul>20 cake pop sticks</ul>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>15 ounce box white cake mix , cook according to package directions in a 9×13" pan</ul>
        <ul>10 ounce package dark chocolate melting wafers</ul>
        <ul>10 ounce package white chocolate melting wafers</ul>
        
        <h5>Buttercream Frosting</h5>
        <ul>1 stick salted butter , softened</ul>
        <ul>2-2 1/2 cups powdered sugar</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
        <ul>1 Tablespoon heavy cream or milk</ul>
        
        
        
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <h5>Make Buttercream Frosting</h5>
        <ol>1) In a medium bowl, whip the butter. Add in 1 cup of powdered sugar. Mix until combined. Add the vanilla and additional powdered sugar, a little at a time. Add 1 Tablespoon of heavy cream or milk to make the frosting thick and creamy. It should hold a point.</ol>
        
        <h5>Make Cake Pops</h5>
        <ol>1) In a large bowl, crumble the prepared cake into fine crumbs (make sure it has cooled completely before crumbling). Add 2 spoonfuls of buttercream frosting to the cake. Combine with your hands or a spoon. Gradually add more frosting until the cake holds together if squeezed. You don't want it too crumbly or it won't hold together.</ol>
        <ol>2) Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop out 1 scoop of cake mixture. Roll into a ball and place onto a plate. Repeat until all the cake mixture has been formed into balls. Freeze balls for about 10 minutes.</ol>
        
        <h5>Dip in Chocolate</h5>
        <ol>1) Right before they are ready to be taken out of the freezer, melt the dark chocolate and the white chocolate in two separate microwave safe bowls. Begin by heating for 30 seconds and then stirring. Once coated in chocolate, gently tap the stick on the side of the melting dish to let the excess drip off. You can also spin or twirl the cake pop to remove the excess.</ol>
        <ol>2) Before the chocolate starts to harden, add sprinkles, jimmies or other decorations. If decorating with more chocolate, let the chocolate covering harden on the cake pop. Then, using a spoon or fork, drizzle with the additional melted chocolate.</ol>
        <ol>3) Push the cake pop stick into a styrofoam block or use a glass filled with rice to hold them upright. The chocolate will be set in about an hour. Store for 3-4 days in an airtight container in a cool place.</ol>
        
        
        
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <li>You can also use 8 ounces of frosting from the store (half of a 16 ounce can) to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Make sure that you’re only working with about five cake pops at a time. Leave the rest in the freezer so that they don’t soften too much while you work on the others. You want them to be really cold when working with them. </li>
        <li>After dipping the stick in melted chocolate, let it dry first before sticking into the cake ball. It’s easier to work with this way and is less likely to fall off when dipping the whole cake pop into melted chocolate.</li>
        <li>Discard any brown edges of the cake before crumbling. </li>
