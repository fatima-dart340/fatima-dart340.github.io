        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        
        <ul>1/2 cup butter</ul>
        <ul>1/2 cup granulated sugar</ul>
        <ul>1/4 cup brown sugar packed</ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</ul>
        <ul>1 large egg</ul>
        <ul>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</ul>
        <ul>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</ul>
        
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>1) Preheat the oven to 350 F.</ol>
        <ol>2) Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</ol>
        <ol>3) In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</ol>
        <ol>4) Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</ol>
        <ol>5) Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour.</ol>
        <ol>6) Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</ol>
        <ol>7) Stir in chocolate chips.</ol>
        <ol>8) Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.</ol>
        <ol>9) Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</ol>
        
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ol>1) Be sure to fluff and then scoop and sweep to measure the flour. Too much flour will result in a dry or crumbly cookie.</ol>
        <ol>2) Or Â¼ teaspoon table salt.</ol>
        <ol>3) Don't over-bake the cookies, or you won't end up with soft cookies. Several people have said that they've needed to bake the cookies for longer. Since oven temps can vary, I suggest starting with the listed baking time and increasing the time as needed.</ol>
